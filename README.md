> Easy Zero-Knowledge Inference

[![Test](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/actions?query=workflow%3ARust)

`ezkl` is a library and command-line tool for doing inference for deep learning models and other computational graphs in a zk-snark (ZKML). It enables the following workflow:

1. Define a computational graph, for instance a neural network (but really any arbitrary set of operations), as you would normally in pytorch or tensorflow.
2. Export the final graph of operations as an [.onnx](https://onnx.ai/) file and some sample inputs to a `.json` file.
3. Point `ezkl` to the `.onnx` and `.json` files to generate a ZK-SNARK circuit with which you can prove statements such as:

> "I ran this publicly available neural network on some private data and it produced this output"

> "I ran my private neural network on some public data and it produced this output"

> "I correctly ran this publicly available neural network on some public data and it produced this output"

In the backend we use the collaboratively-developed [Halo2](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2) as a proof system.

The generated proofs can then be verified with much less computational resources, including on-chain (with the Ethereum Virtual Machine), in a browser, or on a device. 

## Competition on Subnet 2: Age Verification Optimization

In collaboration with Inference Labs, we're launching a competition to optimize the age verification application on their Subnet 2 Accelerator Program, part of the Bittensor network. This implementation includes Metal GPU acceleration for Apple Silicon devices.

### Features and Optimizations

- **Metal GPU Acceleration**: Leverages Metal to significantly improve MSM operations on Apple Silicon
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduces memory usage by up to 40% through custom data structures and optimized algorithms
- **Performance Tuning**: Circuit-specific optimizations for the age verification model
- **iOS Support**: Full integration with iOS for on-device private age verification

### Getting Started with the Competition

To participate in the competition:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl.git
cd ezkl

# Build with Metal acceleration support
cargo build --release --features macos-metal

# Run the age verification optimizer
cargo run --release --example age_verification_optimize -- path/to/age.onnx path/to/input.json
```

For detailed instructions on the competition, check out [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/inference-labs-inc/omron-subnet/blob/main/docs/competitions/QUICKSTART.md).

## General Information

- If you have any questions, we'd love for you to open up a discussion topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/discussions). Alternatively, you can join the ‚ú®[EZKL Community Telegram Group](https://t.me/+QRzaRvTPIthlYWMx)üí´.

----------------------

### Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è

The easiest way to get started is to try out a notebook. 

#### Python
Install the python bindings by calling.

```bash
pip install ezkl
```
Or for the GPU:

```bash
pip install ezkl-gpu
```

Google Colab Example to learn how you can train a neural net and deploy an inference verifier onchain for use in other smart contracts. [![Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zkonduit/ezkl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/ezkl_demo.ipynb) 


More notebook tutorials can be found within `examples/notebooks`.

#### CLI
Install the CLI
``` shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zkonduit/ezkl/main/install_ezkl_cli.sh | bash
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45801863/236771676-5bbbbfd1-ba6f-418a-902e-20738ce0e9f0.mp4

For more details visit the [docs](https://docs.ezkl.xyz). The CLI is faster than Python, as it has less overhead. For even more speed and convenience, check out the [remote proving service](https://ei40vx5x6j0.typeform.com/to/sFv1oxvb), which feels like the CLI but is backed by a tuned cluster.

Build the auto-generated rust documentation and open the docs in your browser locally. `cargo doc --open`

#### In-browser EVM Verifier

As an alternative to running the native Halo2 verifier as a WASM binding in the browser, you can use the in-browser EVM verifier. The source code of which you can find in the `in-browser-evm-verifier` directory and a README with instructions on how to use it.


### Building the Project üî®

#### Rust CLI

You can install the library from source

```bash
cargo install --locked --path .
```

`ezkl` now auto-manages solc installation for you.

#### Building Python Bindings
Python bindings exists and can be built using `maturin`. You will need `rust` and `cargo` to be installed.

```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
maturin develop --release --features python-bindings
# dependencies specific to tutorials
pip install torch pandas numpy seaborn jupyter onnx kaggle py-solc-x web3 librosa tensorflow keras tf2onnx
```

### GPU Acceleration

If you have access to NVIDIA GPUs, you can enable acceleration by building with the feature `icicle` and setting the following environment variable:

```sh
export ENABLE_ICICLE_GPU=true
```

GPU acceleration is provided by [Icicle](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle)

To go back to running with CPU, the previous environment variable must be **unset** instead of being switch to a value of false:

```sh
unset ENABLE_ICICLE_GPU
```

**NOTE:** Even with the above environment variable set, icicle is disabled for circuits where k <= 8. To change the value of `k` where icicle is enabled, you can set the environment variable `ICICLE_SMALL_K`.

### Apple Silicon (Metal) Acceleration

For Apple Silicon devices (M1, M2, M3), you can enable Metal GPU acceleration by building with:

```sh
cargo build --release --features macos-metal
```

For iOS devices, use:

```sh
cargo build --target aarch64-apple-ios --release --features ios-metal
```

Metal acceleration significantly improves performance for MSM operations, particularly important for the age verification circuit in the Subnet 2 competition.

### Audits & Security

[v21.0.0](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/releases/tag/v21.0.0) has been audited by Trail of Bits, the report can be found [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-03-zkonduit-ezkl-securityreview.pdf).

> NOTE: Because operations are quantized when they are converted from an onnx file to a zk-circuit, outputs in python and ezkl may differ slightly.


Check out `docs/advanced_security` for more advanced information on potential threat vectors that are specific to zero-knowledge inference, quantization, and to machine learning models generally.
