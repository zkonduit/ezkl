`ezkl` is a library and command-line tool for doing inference for deep learning models and other computational graphs in a zk-snark (ZKML). It enables the following workflow:

1. Define a computational graph, for instance a neural network (but really any arbitrary set of operations), as you would normally in pytorch or tensorflow.
2. Export the final graph of operations as an [.onnx](https://onnx.ai/) file and some sample inputs to a `.json` file.
3. Point `ezkl` to the `.onnx` and `.json` files to generate a ZK-SNARK circuit with which you can prove statements such as:

> "I ran this publicly available neural network on some private data and it produced this output"

> "I ran my private neural network on some public data and it produced this output"

> "I correctly ran this publicly available neural network on some public data and it produced this output"

In the backend we use the collaboratively-developed [Halo2](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2) as a proof system.

The generated proofs can then be verified with much less computational resources, including on-chain (with the Ethereum Virtual Machine), in a browser, or on a device.

----------------------

### getting started ‚öôÔ∏è

The easiest way to get started is to try out a notebook. 

#### Python
Install the python bindings by calling.

```bash
pip install ezkl
```
Or for the GPU:

```bash
pip install ezkl-gpu
```

Google Colab Example to learn how you can train a neural net and deploy an inference verifier onchain for use in other smart contracts. [![Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zkonduit/ezkl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/ezkl_demo.ipynb) 


More notebook tutorials can be found within `examples/notebooks`.

#### CLI
Install the CLI
``` shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zkonduit/ezkl/main/install_ezkl_cli.sh | bash
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45801863/236771676-5bbbbfd1-ba6f-418a-902e-20738ce0e9f0.mp4

For more details visit the [docs](https://docs.ezkl.xyz). The CLI is faster than Python, as it has less overhead. For even more speed and convenience, check out the [remote proving service](https://ei40vx5x6j0.typeform.com/to/sFv1oxvb), which feels like the CLI but is backed by a tuned cluster.

Build the auto-generated rust documentation and open the docs in your browser locally. `cargo doc --open`

### building the project üî®

#### Rust CLI

You can install the library from source

```bash
cargo install --locked --path .
```

`ezkl` now auto-manages solc installation for you.




#### building python bindings
Python bindings exists and can be built using `maturin`. You will need `rust` and `cargo` to be installed.

```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
maturin develop --release --features python-bindings
# dependencies specific to tutorials
pip install torch pandas numpy seaborn jupyter onnx kaggle py-solc-x web3 librosa tensorflow keras tf2onnx
```

### GPU Acceleration

If you have access to NVIDIA GPUs, you can enable acceleration by building with the feature `icicle` and setting the following environment variable:

```sh
export ENABLE_ICICLE_GPU=true
```

GPU acceleration is provided by [Icicle](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle)

To go back to running with CPU, the previous environment variable must be **unset** instead of being switch to a value of false:

```sh
unset ENABLE_ICICLE_GPU
```

**NOTE:** Even with the above environment variable set, icicle is disabled for circuits where k <= 8. To change the value of `k` where icicle is enabled, you can set the environment variable `ICICLE_SMALL_K`.

### contributing üåé

If you're interested in contributing and are unsure where to start, reach out to one of the maintainers:

More broadly:

- See currently open issues for ideas on how to contribute.

- For PRs we use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) naming convention.

- To report bugs or request new features [create a new issue within Issues](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/issues) to inform the greater community.


Any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you shall be licensed to Zkonduit Inc. under the terms and conditions specified in the [CLA](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/blob/main/cla.md), which you agree to by intentionally submitting a contribution. In particular, you have the right to submit the contribution and we can distribute it, among other terms and conditions. 

### no security guarantees

Ezkl is unaudited, beta software undergoing rapid development. There may be bugs. No guarantees of security are made and it should not be relied on in production.

> NOTE: Because operations are quantized when they are converted from an onnx file to a zk-circuit, outputs in python and ezkl may differ slightly.
