Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by applying random modifications to the existing data. This can help to improve the performance of deep learning models by providing the model with more diverse training examples. Data augmentation can be useful when the available dataset is small or when the model is prone to overfitting.\n",
